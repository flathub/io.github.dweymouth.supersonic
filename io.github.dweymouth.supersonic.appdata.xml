     <p>
       Beta release of Supersonic!
     </p>
     <p>
       Lots of fixes and new features in this release, including
       ReplayGain support and a brand new settings dialog, and much
       improved memory utilization!
     </p>
     <p>
       Supersonic is free and always will be, but if you are enjoying
       it and want to support the project, donations are always
       appreciated! And if you're a developer, contributions are
       welcome!
     </p>
     <p>
       Edit: there is a minor bug in this release - if you've already
       been running Supersonic off of the fresh code in the main
       branch, when launching this version for the first time the
       update checker may inform you of a "new" version, which is just
       this release. Just select "Skip this version" and it will go
       away until the next release! :)
     </p>
